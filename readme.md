# Visualization Project: Moral Machine

This project aims to visualize differences in morals and culture across the world. It is mainly inspired by the Moral Machine [online experiment](http://moralmachine.net/). The paper can be found [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0637-6.). The data is published [on OSF](https://osf.io/3hvt2/)

## Setup to use raw data

Download and extract the data from [OSF](https://osf.io/3hvt2/) and put the extracted `.csv` files in the `raw` folder. They should be named `ss16pusa.csv`, `ss16pusb.csv`, `ss16pusc.csv`, and `ss16pusd.csv`.
